# BudgetPWA

## Purpose of this app
This 'Progressive Web Application' allows a User to keep track of their money by keeping track of their income and expenses.

This happens by having the User input a name for the reason of the expense and the amount. 

Then it displays a graph to help the User visualize best and worst days of use for their money.

The best attribute of this appplication is that it can still run while being offline!
